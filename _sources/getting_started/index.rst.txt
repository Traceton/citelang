CiteLang is the first markdown syntax for citing software. It allows you to:

1. Generate basic software credit trees
2. Give credit accounting for dependencies
3. Choose the filter or threshold you want for credit

We don't believe that "the traditional academic way" of citing papers makes sense for software.
Why should we be trying to generate separate DOIs (digital object identifiers) when we already have
established ways to "publish" and distribute software using package managers? The getting started
guides here will show you the basics of using CiteLang, and of course if you have a question
or issue, please `let us know <https://github.com/vsoch/citelang/issues>`_
